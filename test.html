					The arrival of Merino sheep brought more trade to Vermont. Valued by the Spanish for their thick wool, Merinos soon replaced the English breeds that had been mostly raised for mutton.</p> 
				<p>By 1820, the wool industry became the main and most profitable industry in Vermont.</p>

				<p>Under high tariffs, the Vermont wool industry thrived.</p>
				<p>In 1835, there were 6 sheep to every person. </p>
